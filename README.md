## Special Thanks
My role model was the Gif collection of [Joel](https://github.com/jglovier/gifs). Thanks for this, mate!

## Contributing

Feel free to open a pull request if you have a gif that you really think belongs in here. However, I will only accept images that I think I will personally want to use.
I'm not trying to build a comprehensive storage place for the world's best gifs, just trying to organize all the gifs I personally use. I sync these locally, so I'll be somewhat selective about adding new stuff. That said, feel free to suggest ones you think are awesome, and if I don't accept the PR just fork the repo and add to your own! :thumbsup:
